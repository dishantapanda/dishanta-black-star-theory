This repository presents Dishanta's Black Star Theory — an alternative to black holes. A massive, dark celestial object with no curvature, no singularity. Based on observation, logic, and a fresh approach to cosmic understanding.



# Dishanta’s Black Star Theory 💫

🔬 A revolutionary alternative to the traditional concept of Black Holes.  
This theory proposes that what we call a “Black Hole” may actually be a massive, perfectly dark celestial object — a "Black Star" — surrounded by visible matter or plasma rings, with no need for singularity or space curvature.

📄 **Research Paper:**  
The PDF file attached below contains the full explanation, visual examples, and question-answer refutations based on modern astrophysical understanding.

## 🔍 Overview
- 🚫 No space curvature
- 🕳️ No actual “hole” in space
- 🌌 Just a massive dark star with gravity
- 💡 Light we see is from matter around it, not "bent" light
- 🌀 Challenges Einstein’s general relativity assumptions
